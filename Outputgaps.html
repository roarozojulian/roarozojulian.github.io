In the paper "Trend-cycle decomposition with hysteresis" we argued that the clean separation between the trend and the cycle is not a convenient assumption. 
As a case in point, the COVID-19 pandemic led to both a fall in supply by disrupting supply chains and it also dampened the demand in some sectors that were 
not directly affected by mobility restrictions. Thus, we proposed a fairly simple addition to an otherwise common local linear trend to capture this joint supply-demand shocks. 
This gives as result a trend cycle decomposition with a trend that can break in the presence of extreme events or economic crisis if they are prolonged enough to damage the production capacity, such as the GFC.
The paper also provides insights to some historical periods such as the guilded age, the 1929 crisis and the World Wars periods.
