In the paper "Trend-cycle decomposition with hysteresis" we argued that the clean separation between the trend and the cycle is not a convenient assumption. 
As a case in point, the COVID-19 pandemic led to both a fall in supply by disrupting supply chains and it also dampened the demand in some sector that were 
not affected by supply chains disruption. Thus, we proposed a fairly simple addition to an otherwise common local linear trend to capture this joint supply-demand shocks. 
This gives as result a trend cycle decomposition with a trend that can break in the presence of extreme events or economic crisis if they are prolonged enough to damage the production capacity, such as the GFC.
