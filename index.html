I'm Julián Roa-Rozo, a young research economist from Colombia. Currently, I’m working as a Project Coordinator at Econometría Consultores, where I've applied impact evaluation techniques to social programs such as 40 mil primeros empleos (a youth employment program) and public policies. Previously, I worked at the Central Bank of Colombia. I hold an M.A. in economics from Universidad de los Andes and a B.A. in Economics from Universidad Nacional de Colombia.
</br>
</br>
I’m interested in macroeconomics.  Specifically, I've studied monetary policy spillovers to Latin American economies and I'm currently working on GDP and unemployment hysteresis.

In this website, you can download output gap estimates for more than 80 economies from a trend-cycle decomposition with hysteresis, from a joint work with Javier Gómez-Pineda.
