I'm Julián Roa-Rozo, a young research economist from Colombia. Currently, I work as a Project Coordinator at Econometría Consultores where I've applied impact evalution to social programs and public policies. Previously, I worked at the the Central Bank of Colombia. I hold an M.A. in economics from Universidad de los Andes and a B.A. in Economics from Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

My research interest focuses on macroeconomics. Specifically I've studied monetary policy spillovers to Latin american economies and I'm currently working on GDP and unemployment hysteresis. 

As a result of my joint research with Javier Gomez-Pineda, in this website, you can download output gap estimates for more than 80 economies from a trend-cycle decomposition with hysteresis.
