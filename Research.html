<strong>Hysteresis elasticities: Evidence from high and middle income economies.</strong>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>
   "Macroeconomics has long assumed that demand shocks do not affect the potential output. This study uses a Bayesian bivariate Kalman filter to estimate the hysteresis elasticities for potential GDP and the NAIRU for 73 economies. It also estimates these elasticities using a simple New-Keynesian model for 28 economies. The main finding suggests that these hysteresis elasticities are high in most economies studied. The latter implies that demand and monetary policy shocks could have long-run effects on potential GDP and the NAIRU, which firmly rejects the natural rate hypothesis. In addition, the study explores cross-country differences and finds evidence supporting the insiders-outsiders explanation of unemployment hysteresis. Similarly, it finds evidence supporting the endogenous TFP theory as a relevant source of GDP hysteresis."
