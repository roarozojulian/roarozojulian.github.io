I'm Julián Roa-Rozo, a young research economist from Colombia. Currently, I work as a Project Coordinator at Econometría Consultores where I've applied impact evalution to social programs and public policies. Previously, I worked at the the Central Bank of Colombia. I hold an M.A. in economics from Universidad de los Andes and a B.A. in Economics from Universidad Nacional de Colombia.
</br>
</br>
My research interest focuses on macroeconomics. Specifically I've studied monetary policy spillovers to Latin american economies and I'm currently working on GDP and unemployment hysteresis.

</br>
As a result of my joint research with Javier Gomez-Pineda, in this website, you can download output gap estimates for more than 80 economies from a trend-cycle decomposition with hysteresis.
