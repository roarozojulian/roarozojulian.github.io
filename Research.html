<strong>Hysteresis elasticities: Evidence from high and middle income economies.</strong>
</p>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Macroeconomics has long assumed that demand shocks do not affect the potential output. This study uses a Bayesian bivariate Kalman filter to estimate the hysteresis elasticities for potential GDP and the NAIRU for 73 economies. It also estimates these elasticities using a simple New-Keynesian model for 28 economies. The main finding suggests that these hysteresis elasticities are high in most economies studied. The latter implies that demand and monetary policy shocks could have long-run effects on potential GDP and the NAIRU, which firmly rejects the natural rate hypothesis. In addition, the study explores cross-country differences and finds evidence supporting the insiders-outsiders explanation of unemployment hysteresis. Similarly, it finds evidence supporting the endogenous TFP theory as a relevant source of GDP hysteresis.

<strong>A trend cycle decomposition with hysteresis</strong>
</p>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
Business fluctuations can be estimated as the product of perturbations that do not need to be broken down into supply and demand shocks. Joint supply and demand (S&D) shocks can help estimate the cycle in the output gap as well as a cycle in trend output. The model is a univariate trend-cycle decomposition with hysteresis in trend output, that enables the estimation of the output gap and trend output in 81 economies in quarterly frequency, since 1995Q1; and 184 economies in yearly frequency, in several cases since 1950, and in a few cases since 1820. Volatility and dispersion, as well as the frequency of large joint trend-cycle shocks, were low during the Gilded Age period; high during the interwar period, even more so in advanced (AD) economies compared to emerging market and developing economies (EMDE); and low in AD economies and high in EMDE economies in the post WWII period. In contrast with other existing estimates of trend output, those from the trend-cycle decomposition with hysteresis do not evolve smoothly, do not result in an artificial boom before recessions and are less sensitive to new data.

<strong>Spillovers de la política monetaria no convencional de los países avanzados hacia América Latina.</strong>
</p>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
In this paper, I estimate the effects of unconventional monetary policies from the
United States, Euro Area, United Kingdom, and Japan (advanced economies) on
Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and Peru using a global projection model with shadow
rates. I found that spillovers are small and the most relevant come from the United
States. I also found that volatility spillovers from advanced economies’ unconventional
monetary policies are negligible. Historical decomposition exercises show that the most
affected variables by spillovers are the real exchange rate and inflation. Finally, I also
simulate counterfactual scenarios in which there were no unconventional monetary
policies from advanced economies past 2008, and I found that Latin American economies
would have had GDP losses close to 0.5% and inflation 1.5% lower at the end of 2014.
This shows the high costs of not implementing these policies and these results are
relevant to the COVID-19 crisis.
